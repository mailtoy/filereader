# Input-Output Tasks
by Kanchanok Kannee

I ran the tasks on a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) with 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5, and got these results:

Task                                          | Time
----------------------------------------------|-------:
Read file 1-char at a time to String          |  1.040304 sec
Read file 1-char at a time to StringBuilder   |  0.778817 sec
Read file line at a time using BufferedReader |  0.757948 sec                                  

## Explanation of Results
